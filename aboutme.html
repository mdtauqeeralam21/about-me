				<h3>More About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                    My proficiency in Java allows me to work with frameworks and tools commonly used in the Java ecosystem, such as Hibernate, Maven, or Spring Boot. I am familiar with version control systems like Git, which enables I to collaborate effectively with team members and track changes in my codebase.

I am comfortable with agile development methodologies, possess strong problem-solving skills, and have a keen eye for detail.
                    With my recent graduation, I am eager to apply my skills and contribute to the development of innovative software solutions. I am open to learning new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry to further enhance my expertise as a Java Full Stack Developer.
